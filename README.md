# React TypeScript Project User Manual

## Introduction

Welcome to the user manual for the React TypeScript project, leveraging the efficiency of Vite and the package management of pnpm. This document will guide you through the processes of installation, configuration, and operation of the project, including the use of Storybook for component visualization and ESLint for code quality assurance.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js**: Version 12 or later. Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine and is essential for running JavaScript code outside a browser.
- **pnpm**: A fast, efficient node package manager. pnpm is known for its speed and efficiency compared to npm or yarn.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project environment:

1. **Clone the Repository**:  
   Use `git clone <repository-url>` to clone the project repository to your local machine. Replace `<repository-url>` with the URL of your Git repository.
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:  
   Change to the project's root directory with `cd <project-directory>`, where `<project-directory>` is the name of the folder created by the clone command.
3. **Install Dependencies**:  
   Run `pnpm install` to install all the necessary dependencies defined in the `package.json` file. pnpm creates a virtual store of node modules, ensuring fast and reliable dependency management.

## Running the Application

The development environment can be started as follows:

- **Start the Development Server**:  
  Execute `pnpm run dev` to start the local development server. Vite, a fast frontend build tool, powers this server.
- **Access the Application**:  
  Once the server is running, access the application at `http://localhost:3000`. This URL points to the local server where your React application is running.

## Building the Application

To create a production build:

- **Build for Production**:  
  Run `pnpm run build` to compile your application into static files for production.
- **Preview Production Build**:  
  After building, you can preview the production build locally by running `pnpm run preview`.

## Storybook Management

Storybook is a tool for developing UI components in isolation. It allows you to view and interact with your components in a separate environment.

### Running Storybook

- **Start the Storybook Environment**:  
  Use `pnpm run storybook` to start the Storybook server.
- **Access Storybook UI**:  
  Open `http://localhost:6006` in your web browser to view and interact with your components.

### Building Storybook

- **Build Storybook for Static Hosting**:  
  Execute `pnpm run build-storybook` to create a static build of your Storybook, which can be hosted on any web server.

## ESLint Configuration

ESLint is a tool for identifying and reporting on patterns found in ECMAScript/JavaScript code, with the goal of making code more consistent and avoiding bugs.

- **Running ESLint**:  
  Run `pnpm run lint` to check your code for any linting issues as per the rules defined in `.eslintrc`.
- **Fixing Lint Errors Automatically**:  
  Use `pnpm run lint -- --fix` to automatically fix many of the linting errors that ESLint finds.

## Vite Configuration

Vite is a build tool that significantly improves the frontend development experience. It's configured in `vite.config.ts`, where you can customize the behavior of Vite for tasks like minifying code, preprocessing CSS, and configuring development server settings.
